    "# Year Filtering Guide\n",
    "Year filtering is necessary in multiple methods (load, load_iter, load_from_csv, get_count, get_agencies) of the Source class that is used to interact with datasets from a particular agency. In most cases, the basic year filtering described in the [Getting Started Guide](./index.ipynb) is all that is needed. However, this guide is provided to document how to handle the rare more complex cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Year filtering serves 2 purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identifying which single dataset to request data or information from\n",
    "* Filtering a dataset for only a specified year or for a date/year range\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**: The combination of inputs including `year` for the load, load_iter, load_from_csv, get_count, and get_agencies methods must specify a single dataset. OPD requires this because the structure and contents of different datasets can differ even between what appear to be the same data from the same source but for 2 different years. After loading data with OPD, you can [concatenate](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) datasets manually using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide describes how to handle the following cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Request single year of single year dataset](#request-single-year-of-single-year-dataset)\n",
    "* [Request single year of multi-year dataset](#request-single-year-of-multi-year-dataset)\n",
    "* [Request all of a multi-year dataset](#request-all-of-a-multi-year-dataset)\n",
    "* [Request year range of a multi-year dataset](#request-year-range-of-multi-year-dataset)\n",
    "* [Request date range of a multi-year dataset](#request-date-range-of-multi-year-dataset)\n",
    "* [Filtering of Excel and CSV Files with load_iter and get_count](#filtering-of-excel-and-csv-files-with-load_iter-and-get_count)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most datasets associated with a single source and table type are either contained in a single multi-year dataset or in multiple single year datasets. To better demonstrate year filtering concepts, this guide will mostly use Use of Force datasets from Northampton and Asheville because Northampton consists of a multi-year dataset AND a single year dataset and Asheville consists of 2 multi-year datasets."
